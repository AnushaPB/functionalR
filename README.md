# Functional programming in R

Functional programming provides a powerful way to write code that is easier to write, read, and maintain. In this tutorial, you will learn how to use functional programming to write more expressive and efficient code in R using the `purrr` package. You will also learn how to apply a functional approach to a real-world research problem: downloading and cleaning species occurrence data. This material is based on Hadley Wickham's book [Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/).

To get started, open the `functionalR.Rmd` file in your R environment of choice. You can also use GitHub codespaces to run the tutorial in the cloud.

## GitHub Codespaces

GitHub codespaces provides a cloud-based environment for running evodoodle right in your browser. To start a GitHub codespace, **click the green CODE button in the upper-right corner of this repository and select `Open with Codespaces`.** This will open a new codespace in your browser with all the required packages installed and ready to go. **The codespace will take some time to start (5+ minutes).** For more information on codespaces check out the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces).
